#summary How to install and run mail-trends
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

=Requirements=

  * A Gmail or Google Apps mail account
  * Python 2.5 or later
  * A [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] client

=Installation=

Grab a snapshot of the current version of mail-trends with:

{{{svn checkout http://mail-trends.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mail-trends}}}

=Running=

Go into the mail-trends directory:

{{{cd mail-trends}}}

Run the program, replacing the username and passwords as appropriate (if you omit the password in the commandline you will be (securely) prompted for it):

{{{
./main.py \
  --server=imap.gmail.com \
  --use_ssl \
  --username=username@gmail.com \
  --password=password \
  --skip_labels
}}}

The output is in HTML, placed in {{{out/index.html}}}. Open that in your favorite web browser.

=Other options=

You can pass in {{{--record}}} and {{{--replay}}} as command line arguments to respectively capture and play black message fetches from the IMAP server. This is meant to aid in development by speeding up data fetches.

{{{--max_messages=NNNN}}} can be used to limit the number of messages that are fetched.
